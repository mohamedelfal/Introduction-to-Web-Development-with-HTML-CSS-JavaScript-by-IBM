# Project Preparation
Your task is to develop a web application that looks as follows:

![1](./image/1.png)

The application calculates the simple interest after the user enters the principle, interest rate and the duration in years. For example, if the user enters 1000000 as amount, 3.5 as rate of interest and 5 as No. of years, the following message is shown after the user clicks on the "Compute Interest" button.

If you deposit 1000000,
at an interest rate of 3.5%.
You will receive an amount of 175000,
in the year 2025

Now that you know what has to be done. Let us prepare the environment for you to get started.

## Objectives
* 1- Fork the project.
* 2- Create GitHub pages to publish the project.

## Exercise 1 : Fork the project
* 1- Login to your GitHub.
* 2- Fork the repo at https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/vftvk-Simple-Interest-Calculator

## Exercise 2 : Publish on GitHub pages
**GitPages** allows you to publish the content on your git repo as a web site, which can be accessed by anyone on the internet.

You can use this feature to publish any of your projects. Let us create a URL for the project you are about to complete.

* 1- Navigate to your project repo.(The one you have forked earlier)

* 2- Go to the settings page.

* 5- You will see the URL for your repository.

*If your git username is watson34 and reponame is vftvk-Simple-Interest-Calculator, your URL would be http://watson34.github.io/vftvk-Simple-Interest-Calculator*

* 7- When you open this URL in a browser you should see the unfinished Simple Interest Calculator project. If you get '404' error page, please be patient. It may take upto 60 minutes for the website to show up after you have created the URL.

* 8- Save this URL. You will asked to submit this URL for peer review **that comes next in the course.**
